I am a Ph.D student in [GRAIL](https://grail.cs.washington.edu/) at University of Washington, co-advised by [Prof. Brian Curless](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~curless/), [Prof. Steven Seitz](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~seitz/) and [Prof. Ira Kemelmacher-Shlizerman](https://www.irakemelmacher.com/). My research interests include Neural Rendering, 3D Vision and AR/VR application.

During my study, I am fortunate to have opportunities to work with [Prof. Min Sun](https://aliensunmin.github.io/) in National Tsing Hua University, [Prof. Jia-Bin Huang](https://filebox.ece.vt.edu/~jbhuang/) at Virginia Tech, and [Dr. Johannes Kopf](http://johanneskopf.de/) at Facebook.
