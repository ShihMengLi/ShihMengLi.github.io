I am a graduate student working with [Prof. Min Sun](https://aliensunmin.github.io/) in the Electrical Engineering department at National Tsing Hua University. My research topics include **View Synthesis and 3-D Reconstruction**. During my internship at [Virginia Tech](https://ece.vt.edu/), I worked with [Jia-Bin Huang](https://filebox.ece.vt.edu/~jbhuang/) on Novel View Synthesis problem.
